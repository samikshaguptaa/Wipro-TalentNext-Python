#1. Write a program to read the entire content from a txt file and display it to the user.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

#2. Write a program to read first n lines from a txt file. Get n as user input.
n = int(input("Enter the number of lines to read: "))
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    for i in range(n):
        print(file.readline().strip())

#3. Write a program to accept input from user and append it to a txt file.
text = input("Enter text to append: ")
with open("sample.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write(text + "\n")

#4. Write a program to read contents from a txt file line by line and store each line into a list.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]
print(lines)

#5.  Write a program to find the longest word from the txt file contents,
    # assuming that the file will have only one longest word in it.
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    words = file.read().split()
    longest = max(words, key=len)
print("Longest word:", longest)

#6. Write a program to count the frequency of a user entered word in a txt file.
word = input("Enter the word to search: ")
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    count = content.split().count(word)
print(f"The word '{word}' appears {count} times.")
